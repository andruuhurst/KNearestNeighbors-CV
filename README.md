## CS 499 Deep Learning Coding Project 2

created by Isai Martinez and Andrew Hurst

### KFoldCV , NearestNeighborCV

these functions can be found at the following link:
[NearestNeighborCV](https://github.com/IM8065/KFoldCV/blob/master/KFoldCV.R)

### How to run:

R is an interactive language, making it easy to run this code line by line.
Open the following R script in R studio.
This script Formats the data and allows you to run the Nearest Neighbors algorithm,
plot the metrics of the model, as well as compare it to other models.
